    <h1> Hotel 89 </h1>
    <p> Road 89 - one of the largest highways in the province. Traveling through this area, you can observe that almost no life can be seen through the environment around it. </p>
    <p> Getting stuck in this road would almost guarantee death because vehicles or buildings are rarely found in this region.  </p>
    <p> Unfortunately for Evan and his two friends, Josh and Winston, who were on a trip to see a concert in another city. They chose to use this highway since it was the fastest route to reach the city in time, but they were running out of gas and the sun was starting to set... </p>
    <p> To their luck, they see a station nearby named "Hotel 89." It has a gas station they can use to refill their vehicle and has rooms for them to sleep for the night. </p>
    <p> After filling their van with gas, they enter the hotel to stay for the night. The woman on the counter gave them keys with a room number on it. </p>

  <p> The highest room number that the men retrieved is number <em id = "maxi"> </em>. </p>
  <p> The friend group started talking with the woman for a while. The woman's name was <em id = "letterr"> </em>ara, whose name starts with <em id = "letterrr"> </em>. </p>
  <p> She said there are many more of her sisters who work in this hotel, but they all have different tasks. </p>
  <p> The friend group ended up spending (<em id = "timeeee"> </em> mins) <em id = "hourss"> </em> hr <em id = "minss"> </em> mins hanging out in the hotel lobby before going to their respective rooms to rest for the day. </p>
  <p> The next day, the group wakes up and waves the woman goodbye, leaving the hotel to continue their trip to the concert in the city ahead. </p>
